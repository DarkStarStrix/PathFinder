# Maze Solver with A* Algorithm

This project implements a maze solver using the A* algorithm. The goal is to find the shortest path from the start to the goal in a maze with obstacles.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: The maze is generated with random walls (obstacles) to create a challenging environment.

- **A* Algorithm**: The A* algorithm is employed to find the optimal path from the start to the goal, considering the maze's layout.

- **Visualization**: The Pygame library is used to visualize the maze, pathfinding process, and the final solution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (install with `pip install pygame`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git

 cd maze-solver
 
pip install -r requirements.txt

python maze_solver.py

Customization
Adjust the maze dimensions, number of obstacles, and other parameters in the maze_solver.py file.
